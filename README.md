# mnvb
the first most simplest CMS ready to upgrade
I have put together this very simple database driven CMS togeather,
In this version of MnvB-CMS I have used the TinyMCE text editer which attaches to the textarea selector "content" 
everything is saved into a database and there is a tidy little link tree on the left,
there is a read me .txt file included with simple instructions on any changes that you will need to make to suit your sites needs,
There is also a .sql file included to help setup the needed mysql tables within your database.
once this system is installed onto your server you will find there is an admin area for which you will need to create a user and password to edit the page contents.
As clearly stated at the top of this readme this is a very basic system and is only designed to work for a very small website such as a personal site or very small company you can add as many admin users as you want to to the system or even delete users when needed,
for further information about this system please email me: baxt01@hotmail.com
